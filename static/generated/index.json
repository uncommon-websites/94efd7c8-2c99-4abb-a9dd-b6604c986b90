    "prompt": "A marketing leader thoughtfully reviewing brand materials with a small team in a warm, sunlit creative studio. The space is filled with honey-toned wood tables, natural textures, and subtle pops of color. Amber golden hour light bathes the scene, creating a welcoming, energetic mood. The team—diverse, casually professional, ages 25-45—leans in, mid-discussion, with printed materials and wellness product samples spread out. The environment feels lived-in, approachable, and collaborative, with plants and creative supplies visible in the background. Editorial documentary style, off-center framing, soft shadows, and genuine, engaged expressions.",
